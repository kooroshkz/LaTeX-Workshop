# LaTeX-Workshop

This repository contains the slides, materials, and examples for the **LaTeX Workshop** presented by Dalia Kamalzadeh & Koorosh Komeili Zadeh. The workshop focuses on teaching students how to use LaTeX for writing professional documents, especially for Calculus assignments and scientific articles. Overleaf is used for hands-on demonstrations due to its ease of use and online collaboration features.
